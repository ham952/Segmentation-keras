 Implementation of FCN and UNet Architectures in Keras

This repository includes implementation of following FCN implementations for segmentation task
 ```
 1. FCN8-VGG16
 2. FCN8-VGG19
 3. FCN8-ResNet50
 ```
Furthermore a custom FCN architecture is also implemented refered here as FCN2 including
```
 1. FCN2-VGG16
 2. FCN-VGG16
 3. FCN2-ResNet50
```
Lastly, Unet architecture is implemnted on VGG16 as following
```
 1. UNet-VGG16
```

## Results

### 1. FCN2 Vs FCN8 Implementations
